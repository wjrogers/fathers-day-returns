# Father's Day Returns
https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/fathers-day-returns

This pack is just some mods I enjoy playing plus a little bit of loving integration. There are only a few significant customizations:

- Remove presses, the inscriber, and most in-world crafting from Applied Energistics 2, replacing them with simpler crafting recipes, some using the Induction Smelter.
- Tweak a handful of conservative, "balanced" default settings to reduce stress where I don't think it takes away from the fun (Acqueous Accumulator is an infinite source, Excavator veins don't run out, etc.)
- Improve integration in simple ways by adding additional cross-mod processing recipes
- Disable the vanilla bread recipe, requiring wheat or barley be ground into flour, then "baked" (smelted)
- Disable everything in PlusTiC except the three Botania metals.
- Disable the Tinker's Construct flint and leather recipes because they're too easy and there are lots of other sources
- Remove Natura sticks, replacing them with vanilla sticks in all recipes.
